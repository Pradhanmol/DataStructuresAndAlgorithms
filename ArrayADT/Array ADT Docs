* Reverse Array 
  For Understanding array taking array size =10; length =10;
   with filled this data 
   	A = {8,3,9,15,6,10,7,2,12,4}

   	Taking Auxillary array 
   	i.e B = {4,12,2,7,10,6,15,9,3,8}

   	How much taking time to reverse a array ?
   	 1. A-> B - n times to taking the copy of array from b to a 
   	 2. B-> A - n time to taking the copy of array from a to b

   	 so time complexity is -> n+n = 2n so here degree of n is zero so time comlexity is O(n).
