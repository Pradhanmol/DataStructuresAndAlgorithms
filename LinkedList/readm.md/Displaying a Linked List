Topic: Displaying a Linked List
Objective:

Understanding traversal through a linked list.
Creating a function to display all elements of the linked list.
Process of Traversal:
Traversal involves visiting all nodes of the linked list.
Starting from the first node (first pointer), we create a temporary pointer P.
P is initially set to point to the same node as first.
Traversing Method:

Move P to the next node by assigning P = P->next.
This process continues, moving P to subsequent nodes.
Traversal Loop:
Utilizing a while loop for traversal.
Continuation condition: while (P != NULL)
As long as P is not pointing to NULL, the loop continues.
Displaying the Linked List:
Within the traversal loop:
Utilizing printf("%d", P->data) to display the data of each node.
Moving P to the next node (P = P->next) after displaying the data.
Function Creation:
A function display() is introduced, accepting first as a parameter.
To call the function:
display(first) is invoked, passing the first pointer.
Final Remarks:
Traversal of a linked list is crucial for performing various operations.
Displaying elements, counting nodes, searching, or sortingâ€”all achievable through traversal.
display() function encapsulates the traversal process, aiding in showcasing all elements of the linked list.
These notes summarize the lecture's main focus on traversing and displaying a linked list. They highlight the importance of traversal in manipulating linked list elements and introduce a display() function to exhibit all nodes of the linked list. The explanation elucidates the traversal process using a temporary pointer P and a while loop, emphasizing the significance of these components in linked list operations.
