Introduction with Comparison B/W Array & LinkedList
	Diagram 1: Array Representation

			| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
			* Horizontal line segmented into five parts.
			* Element positions marked at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

	Diagram 2: Linked List Node Structure

			Node 1        Node 2        Node 3
			+------+      +------+      +------+
			|  8   |      | 12   |      |  7   |
			+------+      +------+      +------+
			|  ->  |----->|  ->  |----->| null |
			+------+      +------+      +------+
			* Three nodes in a vertical alignment.
			* Each node contains:
				Upper Section: Element value (8, 12, 7).
				Lower Section: Pointer to the next node or 'null'.

			Array Representation            Linked List Representation
			---------------------            -------------------------
			| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |            Node 1  -> Node 2  -> Node 3 -> null
			---------------------            +------+   +------+   +------+
			                                 |  8   |   | 12   |   |  7   |
			                                 +------+   +------+   +------+
			Array: Horizontal segmented line indicating fixed positions.
			Linked List: Nodes connected via pointers forming a chain.

				You can utilize these text representations as visual aids while reviewing or incorporating them into your notes for reference.


====Linked list explain====

		Topic: Understanding Linked Lists
			Introduction:
			* Definition of a Linked List.
			* Basics: Node structure, creation, and access.
			* Differences in C and C++ for Node creation.


	Diagram 1: Linked List Structure

			Node 1        Node 2        Node 3
			+------+      +------+      +------+
			|  8   |      | 3    |      | ...  |
			+------+      +------+      +------+
			|  210 |      | 270  |      | ...  |
			+------+      +------+      +------+
				* Addresses arbitrarily chosen (210, 270, etc.) for illustrative purposes.
				* Node Definition and Structure:
				* Nodes consisting of data and address pointers.

	- A Node comprises data and a pointer to the next Node.
	- struct node definition: data (integer) and next (pointer to the next node).


Memory Allocation:

	Node size: 4 bytes (data + pointer size).
	Addresses non-contiguous due to heap allocation.
		Node Creation:
			In C: Allocation with malloc and type casting.
			In C++: Simplified with new node (allocated in heap).
				Diagram 2: Node Creation Process
						P (Pointer)
						|
						v
						+------+------+
						| Data | Next |  <- Node (500)
						+------+------+
						Pointer P created in stack.
						Node 500 allocated in heap with data and next pointer.
		Accessing Node Members:
			Accessing node members using -> operator.
			Example: Assigning P->data = 10 and P->next = NULL.
Summary:
Node Structure: Data and pointer to next node.
Memory Allocation: Non-contiguous allocation in heap.
Creation: Varied process in C and C++.
Access: Utilizing -> for member access.
These notes describe the lecture content regarding linked lists, their structures, memory allocation, node creation, and member access methods. Diagrams accompany the text, aiding in visualizing the node structure and creation process.
